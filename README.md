## Project Motivation<a name='motivation'></a>

For this project, I was interstested in using Airbnb historical data in Seattle from 2016.1 - 2017.1 to better understand:

1. What is the price vibe for neighbourhood in Seattle, is there any places more expensive?
2. What is the seasonal effect to the price, which is the busiest time to visit Seattle and how much price spikes?
3. What is the day of week effect to the listing price?
4. Which effect drive price spike more, comparing seasonal and day of week effect
